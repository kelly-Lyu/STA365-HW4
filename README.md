## Questions Overview

### **Q1: Converting Gibbs Sampler to Metropolis within Gibbs**
This question involves modifying a Gibbs sampler to incorporate the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within it. The task focuses on using the joint distribution and ensuring the proposals remain valid for strictly positive parameters.

### **Q2: Adjusting Metropolis within Gibbs**
This question requires refining the Metropolis within Gibbs sampler with a dependent proposal for \( \tau \) and a non-normal prior for \( \theta \). The demonstration contrasts the Bayesian inference provided by this approach with traditional Gibbs sampling.

### **Q3: Transition Kernel for Metropolis-Hastings**
This question derives the transition kernel for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm targeting a stationary distribution \( p \). The solution involves computing acceptance probabilities and constructing the transition matrix, verifying that the stationary distribution matches the target.
